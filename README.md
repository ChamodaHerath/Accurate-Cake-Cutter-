# Accurate-Cake-Cutter
This project aims to design a system that accurately cuts cakes to the desired weight. Using ultrasonic sensors to measure dimensions, and stepper and servo motors with a sliding knife, the system calculates and cuts the cake precisely, ensuring customer satisfaction and reducing manual cutting errors.
